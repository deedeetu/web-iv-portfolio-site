			<p>Hi there! My name is Duyen Tu, but I like DeeDee for short.</p>
			<p>I currently am attend Southeast Community College, and I'm majoring in Graphic Design, Web Design and I also am a freelance makeup-artist. I have a passion for music, fashion, makeup and design and have always kept those obsessions around my whole life.</p>
			<p>What inspired me? Honestly, everything! The season, the small little street sign, the graffiti, and everything that I can sense. If you ask me why I love graphic designing so much, I probably can’t give you a straight answer. Graphic design is in everything you see, just like it is a part of my life that I can’t live without.</p>
			<p>Web Design is my passion. I started messing with codes back when such thing as Xanga exist. Xanga is a blogger website that let you set up your own layout with codes, in case you don’t know. Then moving on to Myspace, I also did a little messing with that. Yet it took me a bit to realized my passion, but hey it’s better late than never. </p>
			<p>Graphic Design is my stress reliever. When working on a design, I get so into it that I forget whatever else is going on around me. The best part is seeing your own design being publish on a product or on a poster. It would really make any designer cry!</p>
			<p>Makeup is my life. I started using makeup back in highschool to hide my acnes. Little did I know it became a huge part of my life. I live makeup and breathe makeup. I learned it all by myself by watching Youtube tutorials, so I decided to start a channel for myself to teach other. By the way the link to my Youtube is on the right side if you’re interested! Then when my friend asked me to do hers and her bridemaids makeup for her wedding, I was skeptical at first because I’ve never really done it for other people before. Since it was an emergency, I ended up doing their makeup and it turned out really well! so I thought why not be a freelance makeup artist!</p>
